Make a python script that opens up an excel table

ChatGPT
Certainly! To open an Excel table in Python, you can use the pandas library. First, make sure you have pandas installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Then, here's a simple Python script that opens an Excel file:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the path to your Excel file
file_path = 'your_file.xlsx'

# Read the Excel file into a pandas DataFrame
excel_data = pd.read_excel(file_path)

# Display the contents of the Excel file
print(excel_data)
Replace 'your_file.xlsx' with the actual path to your Excel file. This script will read the Excel file using pandas and display its contents.
